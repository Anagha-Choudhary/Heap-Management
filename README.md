# Heap-Management
This project implements a basic memory allocator using a static array to simulate heap memory. It supports:
1.Manual allocation and deallocation
2.Heap visualization
3.Basic block splitting and merging
The goal is to demonstrate fundamental memory management operations without relying on standard dynamic memory functions like malloc or free.
